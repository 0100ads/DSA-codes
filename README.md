## Introduction

This repository includes implementations of common data structures and algorithms used in computer science and software engineering. Each implementation is carefully documented and tested to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Features

- **Data Structures**:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
  - Heaps
  - Graphs
  - Hash Tables
  - Tries

- **Algorithms**:
  - Sorting (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
  - Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS, etc.)
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Divide and Conquer
  - Backtracking
  - String Algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp, etc.)

- **Programming Languages**:
  - Python
  - Java
  - C++
  - JavaScript

## Installation

To get started with the DSA code repository, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-code-repository.git
```

Navigate to the directory:

```sh
cd dsa-code-repository
```

Ensure you have the necessary programming environments set up for the respective languages. For example, to run Python code, you need Python installed on your machine.

## Usage

Each data structure and algorithm is organized into directories based on their category. For example, to run a specific sorting algorithm in Python:

1. Navigate to the `sorting` directory:

    ```sh
    cd sorting
    ```

2. Choose the desired sorting algorithm (e.g., `quick_sort.py`) and run it:

    ```sh
    python quick_sort.py
    ```

Detailed instructions and examples are provided within each script to help you understand how to use and test the implementations.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have an improvement, bug fix, or a new data structure/algorithm implementation, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
    ```sh
    git checkout -b feature-name
    ```
3. Commit your changes:
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Add feature"
    ```
4. Push to the branch:
    ```sh
    git push origin feature-name
    ```
5. Create a pull request describing your changes.
